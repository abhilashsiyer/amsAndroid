# amsAndroid

**Are you facing one of below problems in Android? -**
1. Unable to action on Chrome tab/System prompts
2. Unable to action on multi apps
3. Or finding it troublesome to write scalable code with UiAutomator

**Then, amsAndroid is for you!**

amsAndroid is a simplified implementation of uiAutomator lib, allowing you to write tests with simple methods such as -

- `clickById(String pkgName, String identifier);`
- `clickByText(String textIdentifier);`
- `launchApp(String pkgName);`

without worrying about waiting for the element to be visible or any setup.

amsAndroid also provides additional capability to screenshot test on the cloud.
Allowing you to run screenshot tests across multiple devices on the cloud without worrying about taking a screenshot on each device you test.

Just sign up on [ams-fe](https://ams-fe.web.app/) (get token from Admin - abhilashsiyer@gmail.com) and start screenshot testing with

- `verifyPage(String tagName);`

[ams-fe dashboard](https://ams-fe.web.app) also serves as a dashboard for your test runs executed on Firebase with again ams simplified API's.
